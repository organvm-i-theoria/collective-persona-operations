# Collective Persona Operations

**Multi-agent system for collective identity and persona management across a distributed creative-institutional architecture.**

## Purpose

When a single creator operates across eight organisations, dozens of repositories, and multiple public-facing contexts -- grant applications, open-source communities, commercial products, theoretical publications -- the question of *who is speaking* becomes non-trivial. Collective Persona Operations addresses this by providing a framework for managing, coordinating, and switching between the distinct personas, voices, and identities that emerge from a multi-organ creative practice.

This is not a social-media management tool. It is a theoretical and operational layer for persona coherence: ensuring that the voice used in ORGAN-V (Logos / public essays) is distinguishable from but consistent with the voice used in ORGAN-III (Ergon / commercial products), and that both trace back to a unified authorial identity. The system draws on concepts from multi-agent architectures, identity theory, and narrative construction to treat persona not as a mask but as a functional interface between creator and context.

Within ORGAN-I (Theoria), this repo sits at the intersection of epistemology and praxis. It asks: *how does a system know itself across multiple expressions?* The answer has practical implications for everything from README tone to marketing copy to grant narratives -- all of which must sound like they come from the same mind operating in different registers.

## Planned Capabilities

- **Persona Registry** -- Catalogue of distinct voices/identities with context rules (when to use which)
- **Voice Consistency Engine** -- Validation that outputs across organs maintain coherent authorial identity
- **Context Switching Protocol** -- Rules for transitioning between persona registers (academic, commercial, artistic, public)
- **Multi-Agent Coordination** -- Integration with AI agents to maintain persona fidelity during AI-assisted content generation

## Status

**Stub / Planning** -- This repository currently contains only a `.gitignore`. The conceptual framework is established; implementation will follow as the organ system matures and cross-organ content generation creates the practical need for persona coordination tooling.

## Relationship to the Eight-Organ System

One of 18 repositories in [ORGAN-I: Theoria](https://github.com/organvm-i-theoria). Collective Persona Operations provides the identity-coherence layer that enables a single author to publish credibly across all eight organs without fragmentation. Its outputs will be consumed by ORGAN-V (essay voice), ORGAN-VII (marketing voice), and ORGAN-III (product voice).
